 ## What are Quadratic Attention Payments?
This is a way to give everyone the same level when it comes to exposure to the public in general.

### Imagine a billboard where anyone can upload an image which is promoting some good. You can pay say 2$ for the first minute you want it to be there. And then 4$ for the second minute and so on.
## What have I implemented?
- Anyone can insert an Https Link of an Image , which has an initial life of 1 minute.
- Anyone who thinks that the Ad is providing value to its viewers, can increase its life by paying some additional $ for the next minute.
- The cost of increasing the life of the Ad for the individual address keep increasing .
- The goal is to make this process more democratic rather than end up in the hands of the wealthy.
## How will the Ads be removed after the Expiry?
Anyone who removes the Ad first will get some incentive. Not a big deal to make a bot for some extra money which removes ad as soon it Expires.

## Try it Yourself
Insert an Image link Click on Calculate Button to provide funding for another minute. Click on fund to pay.

After 1 minute try to remove the Ad. If the Ad's life is over, it will remove .
